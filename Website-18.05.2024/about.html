      <p>The Centre has been addressing the natural resource survey, monitoring, and planning needs of the State for over four decades. It actively participates in Department of Space collaborative projects and regularly assists state user departments in planning development activities using Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The Centre has created various thematic and administrative layers at different scales and time periods, serving as the foundation for numerous application projects.

        Notable achievements include the Resource Atlas of Rajasthan, Watershed Atlas of Rajasthan, Ground Water Atlas of Rajasthan, Panchayat Samiti-wise Master Plan of Water Harvesting Structure sites, silt prevention studies in Pushkar Sarovar, Conservation Planning of Jodhpur Lift Canal, Wetland Mapping, Wasteland Mapping, among others. The Centre is equipped with the latest infrastructure facilities for Remote Sensing and GIS-based studies.</p>
